    <h1>My life</h1>
      I'm Devin Glover. I've been writing code since I was 14. Here is a list of cool things I've done in life.

    <h1>A website for a friend</h1>
    <div>
      <img class="imgFit" src="img/yunayuna.png"/>
      This is a website I made for a friend last year. It's fairly basic with a soundcloud player, and a random background generator. I made it in under a few days!
    </div>
    <h1>A website for myself</h1>
    <div>
      <img class="imgFit" src="img/mysite.png"/>
      This is a website I made for myself! It took me real long to design it and build it from scratch. It's probably one of the most advanced things I've ever worked on, but I know things'll get even bigger for me.
    </div>
    <h1>And a website for YR!</h1>
    <div>
      <img class="imgFit" src="img/yrsite.png"/>
      This is a website I made for Interactive. After months and months of UX and designing what it should look like, I finally got it to a point where I could start building it, which was also a process that took just as long. We eventually canned it because YR was rebranding to what YR is now, YR Media.
