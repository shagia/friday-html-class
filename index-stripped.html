These three tags are a few for example: Charset declares what text encoding should be used, Viewport determines how the size of your website should look, and title is, well, the title of your website, which is important! You should always name your websites. -->

    <h1>My life</h1>
      I'm Devin Glover. I've been writing code since I was 14. Here is a list of cool things I've done in life.

    <h1>A website for a friend</h1>
    <div>
      <img class="imgFit" src="img/yunayuna.png"/>
      This is a website I made for a friend last year. It's fairly basic with a soundcloud player, and a random background generator. I made it in under a few days!
    </div>
    <h1>A website for myself</h1>
    <div>
      <img class="imgFit" src="img/mysite.png"/>
      This is a website I made for myself! It took me real long to design it and build it from scratch. It's probably one of the most advanced things I've ever worked on, but I know things'll get even bigger for me.
    </div>
    <h1>And a website for YR!</h1>
    <div>
      <img class="imgFit" src="img/yrsite.png"/>
      This is a website I made for Interactive. After months and months of UX and designing what it should look like, I finally got it to a point where I could start building it, which was also a process that took just as long. We eventually canned it because YR was rebranding to what YR is now, YR Media.
